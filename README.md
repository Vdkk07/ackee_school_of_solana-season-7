# Ackee School of Solana ‚Äî Season 7 Portfolio üöÄ
This repository showcases my learning journey through Ackee School of Solana Season 7, a rigorous, hands-on program focused on building secure, efficient, and production-ready Solana programs using Rust and the Anchor framework.

Throughout this cohort, I built weekly projects and demos that reflect foundational and advanced concepts of Solana smart contract development‚Äîfrom the basics of blockchain and Rust, all the way to custom token programs, frontend integration, and real-world security practices.
