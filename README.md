# Ackee School of Solana — Season 7 Portfolio 🚀
This repository showcases my learning journey through Ackee School of Solana Season 7, a rigorous, hands-on program focused on building secure, efficient, and production-ready Solana programs using Rust and the Anchor framework.

Throughout this cohort, I built weekly projects and demos that reflect foundational and advanced concepts of Solana smart contract development—from the basics of blockchain and Rust, all the way to custom token programs, frontend integration, and real-world security practices.

## 📁 Project Index  
**Week 1: Introduction to Solana & Blockchain**  
- Explored Solana’s core innovations: Proof of History, Sealevel, and high-performance transaction processing. 
- Set up a complete local development environment using Solana CLI and Anchor. 

**Week 2: Rust & Anchor Fundamentals**  
- Learned Rust fundamentals: ownership, lifetimes, and type safety. 
- Built introductory smart contracts using Anchor, and understood how it simplifies Solana development.

**Week 3: Solana Programming Model I**  
- Learned account structure, data storage, and Program Derived Addresses (PDAs).
- Built on-chain programs using Anchor's account validation system.
- Implemented custom error handling and simple stateful logic.

**Week 4: Solana Programming Model II + CPI**  
- Explored Cross-Program Invocations (CPI) and inter-program communication.
- Interacted with the SPL Token program via CPI for token transfers.
- Built a modular smart contract using nested accounts and secure data handling.
